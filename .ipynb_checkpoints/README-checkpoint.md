## **Data Science and ML Projects**

### **Olist Database Analysis**

*Analyze Olist eCommerce public dataset consisting of 100k orders using Postgres SQL for 
advanced in-depth analysis of the interaction between customers and sellers using complex queries. 
The project includes creating a database of tables, joining these tables and performing a statistical 
inquiry into the database to gain neccessary insights.*

|**Type Of Problem**|***Data Wrangling***|
|**Data Format**|***RDBMS***|
|**Tools**|***PostgreSQL, PgAdmin4***|
|**Language**|***SQL***|
|**Keywords**|***wrangling, selection, aggregates***|


### **Credit Card Fraud Prediction**

*The project consists of a highly imbalanced target class. Our goal is to recognize fradulent credit
card transctions so that customers are not charged for purchases they did not make. We deploy ensemble
methods like Random Forest, Xgboost, LightGBM. We furthur try to improve our prediction using blending 
and stacking techniques to get better auc score*

### **NYC Yellow Taxi Fare Prediction**

*In this project we try to predict the total fare for NYC yellow taxi data provided by TLC Inc. We use LightGBM boosting framework and Keras Deep Neural Network to implement regression model. We use Feature Engineering to add new feature to the existing data to improve our model.To access the robustness of our models we use root mean squared error.*

### [**Modern Portfolio Theory**]()

*The aim of this project is to provide an analytical perspective of Modern Portfolio Theory by applying statistical methods on various
assumptions of the theory and test how these assumptions are significant within the modern financial system. We download data using 
twelvedata API for stocks listed on NYSE.*

### [**A/B Testing KKBOX churn rate**]()
*In this project we implement A/B testing techniques using Frequentist approach and 
Bayesian approach to test the significance of churn rate among two group of music listeners, we also implement permuatation-test technique 
to generate null distribution using random shuffling*
